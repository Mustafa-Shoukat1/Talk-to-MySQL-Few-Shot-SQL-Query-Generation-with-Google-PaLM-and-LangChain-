# 🛒 AtliQ Tees: Talk to a Database

Welcome to the AtliQ Tees project! This end-to-end LLM project leverages Google Palm and LangChain to create a system that can seamlessly interact with a MySQL database through natural language queries.

## 🎯 Project Highlights

AtliQ Tees is a T-shirt store selling brands like Adidas, Nike, Van Heusen, and Levi's. Their inventory, sales, and discounts data are stored in a MySQL database. This project builds an LLM-based Q&A system using:
- **Google Palm LLM**
- **Hugging Face embeddings**
- **Streamlit for UI**
- **LangChain framework**
- **Chroma as a vector store**
- **Few-shot learning**

![Project Workflow](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=Project+Workflow)

The store manager can ask questions like:
- How many white color Adidas T-shirts are left in stock?
- How much sales will be generated if all extra-small T-shirts are sold after applying discounts?

The system intelligently generates accurate SQL queries for the given questions and executes them on the MySQL database.

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Run the Streamlit app** by executing:
    ```bash
    streamlit run main.py
    ```

2. **Ask questions** in the web app that opens in your browser.

## ❓ Sample Questions

- How many total T-shirts are left in stock?
- How many T-shirts do we have left for Nike in XS size and white color?
- How much is the total price of the inventory for all S-size T-shirts?
- How much sales amount will be generated if we sell all small size Adidas shirts today after discounts?
